Datafile transformation tool
============================

This software implements an approach to datafile transformation
based on using a machine-readable ontology as the intermediary
between arbitrary datafiles containing items from the ontology.

Installation
============

See file INSTALLATION in this directory.  You will need Python, and
a C compiler if you intend to handle images.

Publication
===========

This approach is described in a publication in The Data Science Journal 
(appearing late 2016).
