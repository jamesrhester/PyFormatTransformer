List of changes to imgCIF DDLm file
===================================

The following changes/additions were made in order to
implement translation to/from NeXus files. The original file was obtained
from Syd Hall (private communication).

* Removal of all 'variant' items (unused in demo)
* Removal of diffrn_refln category (unused in demo)
* diffrn_detector key is diffrn_detector.id only (simplify)
* diffrn_detector.number_of_elements_local added, with dREL method (allow filtering on
  number of elements)
* diffrn_radiation removed (unused in demo)
* array_structure_list_section removed (unused in demo)
* array_data.as_integers_local added (generic integer-valued image)
* category diffrn_scan_simple_axis_local added, together with selection of datanames
  (uncoupled array axis type)
* category simple_data_axis_local added, together with datanames
  (axes of 3D dataset, encoded by NeXus in axes attribute)
* categories goniometer_axis_local, detector_axis_local added (NeXus distinguishes
  detector and goniometer axes)
* vector_convention2 and offset_convention2 added to all axis categories (NeXus uses
  a different axis convention)
* coupling_number_local added to array_structure_list (allow filtering on array axis
  coupling)
* category diffrn_scan_simple_local added (scan of a single axis)
* category full_frame_local added (scans consisting of identically-structured frames
  obtained by scanning a single axis)
* category diffrn_detector_monolithic_local added (describes a single-element detector)
* category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor removed (unused in demo)
* category diffrn_detector_monolithic_element_local added (describes an element belonging
  to a single-element detector)
* category array_element_size removed (unused)
* diffrn_scan.number_of_scanned_axes_local/number_of_detectors_local added (to allow
  filtering on single scan axis/single detector scans)
* category detector_axis_uncoupled_local added (contains uncoupled axes)
* category diffrn_scan_simple_frames_local added (frame information for identically
  constructed frames from a single uncoupled scan axis)
* category array_intensities removed (unused in demonstration)
