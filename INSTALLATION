Installation of Datafile Transformation Utility
===============================================

Overview
========

This software is written in pure Python.  However, some of
its dependencies contain compiled libraries.  The packages
required are PyCIFRW (CIF format support), numpy (calculations),
nexusformat (NeXus support), h5py (HDF5 support), pycbf
(packing/unpacking of CIF images).  Once all of these are
installed, you should be able to run the tests provided
in this directory by typing "python TestGenericInput.py".

Linux
=====

Your distribution will already have Python present. The following
instructions assume use of the Python packaging utility, "pip",
although you should in general use the distribution package manager
for the major packages numpy and h5py. If using pip, which will often
recompile from source code, you will need to separately install the HDF5
libraries (development version) using your distribution package
manager.

Step 1: Install standard packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    apt-get install libhdf5-dev   # Debian HDF5 libraries
    pip install numpy     # or use your distribution's package
    pip install Cython    # only needed when using pip for h5py
    pip install h5py      # or use your distribution's package
    pip install nexusformat #

    
Step 2: PyCBF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyCBF is used in the current package solely in order to
decompress/compress images in CIF files.  All other aspects of the
present package can be used without requiring PyCBF.  PyCBF
version 0.9.5.12 has been tested; some earlier versions (e.g. 0.9.2
presently bundled with Debian) will fail due to being unable to
handle long integer values in images.

Obtain CBFlib from [http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/CBF/]
and follow the instructions for creating CBFlib.  Note that CBFlib
will also install HDF5 libraries which may not match the version used
for h5py, in which case you will need to uninstall h5py from the
distribution and install h5py using pip, which will (hopefully)
recompile using the version of h5py installed by CBFlib.

After this, change into the CBFlib pycbf directory and execute:

::
    
    python setup.py install

This will install pycbf into your python distribution.


Windows/Mac
===========

Unfortunately I do not have access to an appropriate Windows
or Mac systems, so the following instructions are untested.
You will need a C/C++ compiler on your system for pycbf:

1. Install Enthought Canopy (free version) from
   https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/
   This includes h5py and numpy.

2. Install pycifrw (``easy_install pycifrw`` might work)
3. Install nexusformat (``easy_install nexusformat`` might work)
4. Download,compile and install CBFlib: 
   http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/CBF/
5. In the CBFlib "pycbf" directory, run ``python setup.py install``

Testing your installation
=========================

In the main distribution directory, execute the test routines:

::
    python TestGenericInput.py
